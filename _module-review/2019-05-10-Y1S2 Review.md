## CZ1007 Data Structures

**Offered in**: S1, S2

**Course Aims**:
This core programming course aims to develop your understanding in data structures such as linked lists,
stacks, queues and trees that are important for building efficient programs in C programming language,
and are essential for future programming and software engineering courses.

**Expected learning outcome**:
1. Design and implement simple C programs using basic programming constructs.
2. Design and implement pointers, arrays, character strings and structures in C.  
3. Design and implement recursive functions in C.
4. Design and implement dynamic memory allocation in C.
5. Design and implement linked lists, stacks and queues in C.
6. Design and implement tree structures in C.

**My learning outcome**:
Before taking up this course I did not know that there were different ways to efficiently store data. For instance, an array has a fixed number of elements.

**Assessment** :
* Midterm 1 - 40% 
* Midterm 2 - 40% 
* Assignments - 20% 

**Tips for scoring well**:
1. To score in Midterm 1, it is recommended that you finish all the practice questions provided and remember the pseudocode for the practice questions. The practice questions cover all relevant topics taught in the first half of this module which are the basics of C programming language, arrays, pointers, strings and recursion.
